# Introduction

Have you ever come across statements like: ["LEGO sets have proven to be a stable investment over time, with average returns of 10% annually, which is higher than stocks, bonds, gold, and many other collectible items."](https://www.nerdcube.eu/guides/investing-in-lego/#:~:text=some%20extra%20cash.-,LEGO%20sets%20have%20proven%20to%20be%20a%20stable%20investment%20over,passion%20and%20collecting%20for%20profit) or perhaps you've heard the bold claim that ["Investing in Lego is more lucrative than gold, art and wine."](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/10/investing-in-lego-more-lucrative-than-gold-study-suggests). These intriguing snippets certainly catch our eye, making us wonder: are these claims brick-solid or just plastic fantastic?

We're diving headfirst into a massive dataset, which contains almost 2000 Lego sets from 2018 to 2023, comparing different LEGO products across different time periods and countries, including Germany, Canada, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We're uncovering insights into product demand, ownership trends, release timings throughout the year, and the duration a product remains available at the official LEGO store before hitting retail shelves. Join us on this adventure as we uncover fascinating patterns in this incredible game. Who knows, you might just discover the next set that proves to be a safe investment!

**How popular can a set be?**

If we compare the popularity of themes, we can see how we have a main one. It is [Star Wars](https://www.brickeconomy.com/sets/theme/star-wars), which has 49 subthemes and 937 different sets inside, and there is a considerable difference between the number of people who own a product of this theme and the number of people who want it.

**Which subthemes would be the most wanted?**
We wanted to analyze the subthemes and discover which ones are the most wanted compared to the number of people who own them. These parameters could potentially increase the price of a particular set in the future.
